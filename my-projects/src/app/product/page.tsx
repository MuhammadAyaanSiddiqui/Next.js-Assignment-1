                I have worked on several projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and CommonJS (CJS) to build interactive web pages and applications. Through these projects, I've gained strong foundational skills in front-end development, focusing on creating responsive layouts and implementing dynamic JavaScript functionalities. Each project has been an opportunity to enhance my programming expertise and creativity in web design.
